# CH-04-Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

## Purpose

Fourth challenge "Web APIs Challenge:Code Quiz" for the University of Richmond Bootcamp.

As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.
